description: This document allows you to assess if a project has multi-store support.

To estimate the effort for aligning the project's multi-store solution to Spryker's default solution, do the following:

* In `config/Shared/stores.php`, check the multi-store settings.
* Clarify with the customer how their multi-store solution is different from the default Spryker multi-store solution:
    * Is it a single database per store?
    * Are stores deployed simultaneously?
    * How do URLs build per store?
